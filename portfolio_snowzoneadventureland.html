		  I was one of the developers (with Matthew Matl, Samuel Payne, Nicholas Robinson, and Lucas Mayer) for this single-player puzzle-shooter computer game. This was our final project for Computer Graphics (CS 426) at Princeton (2014). We didn't get very much sleep when developing this game, since we spent a total of two weeks to create it, and it was written entirely in C++ (so you know what that means).
