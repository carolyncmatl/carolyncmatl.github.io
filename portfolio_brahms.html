		  This is the third movement of the Brahms Clarinet Quintet, performed by myself on 1st violin, Kristin Qian on 2nd violin, Lawrence Liu on viola, Spencer Shen on cello, and Paul Chang on clarinet in 2016. We called ourselves the Parrini Quintet, named after our fabulous coach :). My chambermates are incredibly talented and fantastic human beings. Some of them have pursued music professionally! I truly miss playing with them all!
