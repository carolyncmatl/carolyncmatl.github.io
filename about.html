    	Welcome, and thank you for visiting my page! I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a recipient of the NSF Graduate Fellowship. I am advised by Professor <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bajcsy/">Ruzena Bajcsy</a> in the <a href="http://hart.berkeley.edu/">HARTLab</a>, and my research focus is on developing and leveraging "unconventional" sensors for robotic manipulation of complicated objects and substances. In particular, my research aims to extract key material parameters through direct interaction and observation of induced signals (e.g., sound or force). The estimated material parameters are then used to reason about the objects or substances for dynamic robotic tasks such as precision pouring.

		  Outside of research, I enjoy painting, photography, playing violin, hiking, skiing, and cooking with my husband <a href="https://mmatl.github.io"> Matthew Matl</a>, who is not only a talented roboticist, but is also an incredible baker.
