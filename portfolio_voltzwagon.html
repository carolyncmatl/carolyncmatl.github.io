		  This project is near and dear to my heart. I worked with (now husband) Matthew Matl on designing and building the Voltzwagon and the wireless glove system to remote-control the car. This was our project for Car Lab (ELE 302) at Princeton (2015). Please excuse the corny video! We had too much fun making it.
