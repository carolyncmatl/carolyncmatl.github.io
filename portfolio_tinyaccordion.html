		  I designed and built this tiny electronic accordion-inspired instrument, which you can play with two fingers. Applying pressure to the "accordion" would increase the volume and sound output of the instrument, and tilting the device would shift the frequency bands of the synthesized sound. This was my final project for Computer and Electronic Music at Princeton (2016). I was running low on sleep at this point, since I was writing my senior thesis at the same time!
